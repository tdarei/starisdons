                <h2>My business plan and promise</h2>
                <p>My company will revolutionize modern economies across the world. I will be hiring for negative-hour
                    contracts, these contracts work by Me the Employer charging you a base fee of £20 a month for being
                    an employee at my business but because of the nature of my business you do not work a single shift
                    nor hour—the £20 goes to me the employer to ensure I continue working for the benefit of the company
                    such as you the employee or the communities and stakeholders that my company targets.</p>

                <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Negative Profit Margin:</strong> We run a negative profit margin and will be 100%
                        transparent about all insider trading knowledge and predictions that can harm and cause other
                        businesses to fail or collapse due to the negligence of their management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Returns:</strong> And hopefully, any returns I make on your £20 can be paid back by the
                        time you pay your next £20 monthly subscription fee.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Employee Absolution</h3>
                <p>I absolve all employees from any criminal activity since you do not know about the acquisition of the
                    intelligence that lets me trade valuable assets or information. You did not participate, authorize,
                    or signal approval of the actions that I took. I will not provide a means of communication between
                    the employees that is public such as telegram channels or discord channels.</p>

                <h3>Power Structure</h3>
                <p>This destroys the current era of companies and businesses because the power is completely given to
                    the employees, who own the company financially.</p>

                <p class="highlight">This is an experimental business model focused on radical transparency, employee
                    protection, and community benefit.</p>
