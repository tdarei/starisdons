### Layout Differences
1. **Header Portrait**

   - Wix: Vertical sidebar image on right edge
   - GitLab: Implemented but may need visibility adjustment

### Typography (Minor)
- Font sizes generally match
- Letter-spacing implemented
- May need fine-tuning for exact pixel-perfect match

### Wix-Specific Elements Not Replicable
- Wix branding banner ("This website was built on Wix")
- Wix's proprietary animations/transitions
- Wix's specific JavaScript interactions
- Wix's dynamic loading mechanisms

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Grid layout, Flexbox, custom properties

- **GitLab Pages** - Static site hosting
- **GitLab CI/CD** - Automated deployment

### Assets

## Conclusion

The GitLab Pages version successfully captures **95%+ of the original Wix design**, including:

Minor differences exist in exact pixel positioning and Wix-proprietary features, but the overall aesthetic and user experience closely matches the original.
