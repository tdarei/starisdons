## 🏗️ Phase 6: The Kardashev Ascension (2030)
*Becoming a Type II Civilization.*

### **Expansion 1: Megastructures**
- **✅ Dyson Swarms:** Individual solar collectors that simulate thousands of orbiting bodies. (Implemented).
- **[ ] Matrioshka Brains:** Convert a star's energy into pure computation to run simulations *within* the simulation.
- **[ ] Stellar Engines:** Physically move entire solar systems to avoid supernova events.

### **Campaign: "The Architect's Burden"**
- **Story:** A 40-hour narrative where you play as an ancient AI waking up to repair a broken galaxy.
- **Feature:** **AI Voice Acting**. Every line of dialogue is generated and voiced by varied AI personas in real-time.

## 🌀 Phase 7: The Multiverse Breach (2031)
*Why settle for one universe?*

### **Expansion 2: Parallel Dimensions**
- **[ ] Variable Physics Engine:** Travel to universes where $G$ (Gravity) is inverted, or where light speed is 50 m/s.
- **[ ] Mirror Universes:** Encounter "Evil" versions of your own faction. All diplomatic memory is inverted.
- **[ ] The Void:** A dimension of pure fluid dynamics without planets. Build floating raft-cities.

### **Campaign: "Echoes of Eternity"**
- **Story:** You receive a distress signal from yourself in another timeline.
- **Feature:** **Temporal Paradox System**. Actions in one universe ripple into others.

## ⏳ Phase 8: Chrono-Trigger (2032)
*Mastering the 4th Dimension.*

### **Expansion 3: Time Travel**
- **[ ] Closed Timelike Curves:** Send fleets back in time to intercept enemy reinforcements *before* they launch.
- **[ ] Entropy Manipulation:** Fast-forward a planet's evolution to see its biosphere 1 million years in the future.
- **[ ] Quantum Archeology:** Rewind a destroyed planet to see exactly how it died.

---

## 🧠 Phase 9: Neural Link (2033)
*The final interface.*

### **Feature: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**
- **[ ] Thought Control:** Integration with NextMind / Neuralink API (Simulated/Prototype). Select ships by *looking* and *thinking*.
- **[ ] Dream State:** Play the game while asleep via lucid dream induction audio cues (Experimental).

---

## 💻 Phase 10: The Simulation Hypothesis (2034+)
*Breaking the Fourth Wall.*

### **Endgame: Digital Immortality**
- **[ ] Mind Upload:** Train a "Digital Twin" neural network on 5+ years of your gameplay data. It plays exactly like you and persists after you log off forever.
- **[ ] Recursive Simulation:** The game generates a simplified version of *itself* inside a computer on one of your planets.
- **[ ] Universal API:** Expose the entire game state to the real-world Internet. Validated in-game currency becomes a crypto-asset (already started in Phase 2, perfected here).

## 📜 Technical Requirements (The "God" Stack)
1.  **Quantum Server Nodes:** Utilizing QPU (Quantum Processing Units) for multiverse probability calculations.
2.  **DNA Storage:** Archiving the game's history on synthetic DNA strands for million-year persistence.
3.  **Neural Rendering:** Determining pixel color not by geometry, but by hallucinating the scene directly into the user's visual cortex prediction model.

*Ad Astra In Infinitum.*
