Your entry through dark corridors and passageways bear no fruit and you begin to think the crew either perished or abandoned the vessel for reasons unknown. No obvious signs of life are present and you begin to wonder at the cargo such a massive vessel. Just then, word comes from one of your search parties, asking you to meet them at their location.

You arrive as the search team keeps watch at what you assume to be a freshly bypassed blast-door, the technician still on his TriPad, no doubt trying to find out more about the ship and its purpose. Their team’s leader beckons you to come closer.

“We didn’t know what you wanted to do with them all.”

You understand immediately once you reach the threshold of the next chamber. A massive hallway filled with millions upon milions of cryosleep pods, all neatly arranged like grim collections. The technician joins you, revealing that the vessel has countless chambers like this throughout the ship totaling a ten million people altogether. He continues relaying that the vessel is dormant with its engines remarkably intact and ready for operation. Everyone looks toward you on how to proceed.
