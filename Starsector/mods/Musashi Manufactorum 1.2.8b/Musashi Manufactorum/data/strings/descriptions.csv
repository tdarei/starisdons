mm_bishamonten,SHIP,"Ghost of Musashi. This legendary design was once Musashi Manufactrum's pride and the most advanced ship built from Musashi's personal shipyard. Musashi integrated three Alpha AI cores into the ship design to help operate it's over gracious weapon system and Musashi's relic ammo feeder that improve the rate of fire, reduce flux use and increase ammunition driver energy which results in stronger ammunition impact. The AI turn against Musashi's fleet and result in a catastrophic civil war and the design scrapped. The ship houses five large ballistic turrets. On this ship, you found only three Beta AI Core. Maybe this is a prototype? Looking at its dominating power, one can only wonder how much more powerful the real one would be...",,,
mm_mikaboshi,SHIP,Musashi Manufactorum's flagship carrier design. Mikaboshi is a carrier version of Amaterasu.  The ship sacrifices one of its large ballistic sockets for carrier 'houses'. The ship system is embedded with the famous Musashi Super Feeder which accurate fire rate and reduces flux cost of all ballistic weapons and the hull is embedded with advanced Musashi's targeting computer.  It has heavy armor and good overall flux management thanks to Musashi's history with the heavy energy industry.

mm_kuzuryu,SHIP,"After Bishamonten's betrayal, Musashi Manufactorum's vows to not design AI integrated craft ever again. But when the extraterritorial invasion comes they're forced to come up with something for their own survival. Their answer is Kuzuryu. Bishamonten's cousin was designed to have restricted main turret arcs to limit its function, meaning it has little user for other roles. Rubionplasmic plants are built outside the hull to reduce corruption risk inside the vessel. This results in visible Rubionplasmic tendrils around power channels along the length of the ship. The ship system is embedded with the famous Musashi Super Feeder which accelerates fire rate and reduces flux cost of all ballistic weapons and the hull is embedded with advance Musashi's targeting computer.",,,
mm_watatsumi,SHIP,"Offensive-focused design from Musashi Manufactorum. Watatsumi features a strange layout took dated back to the 'old Earth's war which dates back to the 18th 'old Earth' century.

mm_moreya,SHIP,"The latest design of cruiser that field four of the newly developed off-hull-Rubioplasmic-engines. Struggling to find safe way to utilize Rubionplasma as a weapon for *REDACTED*, Musashi scientist turn to engine instead. The rubion crystal with sub atomic fusion power drive give this state of the art engines unparallel speed to mass ratio. As the eingines were still in testing period, weapon system is limited. This result in Moreya having large space for cargo, fuel, and personal. At the moment, The ship boasts mixed armaments and three pairs of storm locks that allows for quick deployments.",,,

Each marine is equipped with an exo-spacesuit and a light machine gun. The suit's downsized fighter engine offers extreme power to weight ratio and speed. ,,,
,,,,,
mm_omegagun,WEAPON,An ancient weapon from the very first era of Musashi Manufactorum. Its simple atomic piston launches a huge titanium shell at extreme velocity. Each shell is packed to the brim with explosive substances which usually include Rubion. This primitive mechanism is something to be fearful of even with today's most advanced defensive technology.,,,
mm_goldendome,WEAPON,"Not a weapon in itself but more like an extension, this ancient weapon is designed specifically to mount on an extension socket above Wrath Battery. Its double twin-barrel flak allows it to ward off most small threats. Its glass dome is specifically designed to give as much visibility to its operators as possible.",,,
,,,,,
mm_rubionblastcannon,WEAPON,"Rubioplasmic slug launcher. It is designed to be used solely with *REDACTED*. After AI rebel war, Musashi scrapped the design as no ship have enough flux capacity to use them. The cannon was firstly designed to fire a single slug but with too much heat engineers can manage, the barrel was later split into two to help alleviate heat dispersion. The heat from each rubioplasma shot is so strong the weapon took forever to recharge. It also consumes a huge amount of flux for each shot. The Rubioplasmic slug launch from this cannon is powerful enough to evaporate the cruiser and tear through the orbital station.  ",,,
mm_cryofusionbattery,WEAPON,"Top-of-the-line energy battery from Musashi Manufactorum (aside from *REDACTED). It is rumored that Musashi Manufactory embedded an alien energy core into the turret itself. No one knows if that is true or not. Its triple barrel coupled with advance Rubion plasma slug offers an unparallel punch to both shield and ship alike. Using both Rubion plasmic ammunition and drive system, the heat generated from each shot is so much the terrut must be made by cryosteel.  The heat padding and shielding also reduce the turn rate of the turret. With all aforementioned conditions, Musashi Manufactorum only allows its high-rank official to field this weapon.",,,
mm_hyperblastbattery,WEAPON,"Tripple barrel cannon battery. One of the proudest creations of Musashi Manufactorum. Though it uses standard ammunition, its drive system is powered by Rubion plasmic driver. This results in a fast and high-impact shot. Due to high heat from the driver, Musashi compensates for the downside with a multi-barrel design. This results in high damage, long reload but sustainable salvo.",,,
mm_hypermagneticrifle,WEAPON,Highly advanced hyper rail rifle. The weapon is designed around Musashi Manufactorum's launch-and-load mechanism. The small load mechanism gives more space to the barrel and targeting system. The phase launch system sling the ammunition so fast even the nimblest frigate can't hope to evade. The barrel is large enough to house mothership-killer class ammunition. It is rumored to be able to tear through Paragaon's fortress shield with ease.,,,
mm_flakstormarray,WEAPON,"Hex-barrels long-range flak battery. In contrary to regular flak, this weapon is designed to be used on space vessels. It features a better range than regular flak thanks to Musashi's rangefinder and longer barrel design. The ammunition is specifically designed to contain a high explosive substance composed partly of Rubion.",,,
,,,,,
mm_gigatichowitzer,WEAPON,Most primitive weapon in Musashi Manufactorum's offering.  This giant howitzer's ammo offers extremely high damage.  Its non-electric-mechanical loading combined with a huge payload means an extremely long reload but advantageous flux economy.  The bullet can travel extremely long distances but with limited speed thanks to its primitive inertial drive system.,,,
mm_magneticrifle,WEAPON,"Highly advanced rail rifle.The design is a by-product, a prototype, to test Musashi Manufactorum's launch-and-load mechanism. The mechanism itself is a small system that allows for more space for other components. In this case, the barrel is enlarged enough to store anti-capital strike ammunition. The large ammunition means a longer reload, still, the strike power of this weapon is a wonder to behold.",,,
mm_flakstormbattery,WEAPON,"Tripple barrel long-range flak battery. In contrary to regular flak, this weapon is designed to be used on space vessels. It features a better range than regular flak thanks to Musashi's rangefinder and longer barrel design. The ammunition is specifically designed to contain high explosive substance composed partly of Rubion.",,,
mm_cryoflamser,WEAPON,"Highly advanced Rubionflame laser. A sophisticated phase condenser condenses Rubion plasma into a super-dense energy slug. The slug is then stored inside the phase-field magazine. When in need, the slug slid into the barrel and engaged with the launch system. Half of the stored energy is used to fire the slug which decreases its power but reduces energy consumption and allows for a better rate of fire. ",,,
mm_autoflakpd,WEAPON,Twin barrel anto-flak turret.  Special autoloaders promise a high rate of fire to dish out as many shrapnel slugs into the space as possible.  It also has improved range over flak thanks to a special auto-rangefinder.,,,
mm_miniflakpd,WEAPON,Twin barrel anto-flak turret.  Special autoloaders promise a high rate of fire to dish out as many shrapnel slugs into the space as possible.  It also has improved range over flak thanks to a special auto-rangefinder.,,,
mm_cryospoolpd,WEAPON,"Highly advanced Rubionflame point defense. Twin injector on each side injects flame into a sphere shape storage in the middle of the turret, AKA ""Orb"". This ""Orb"" allows the flame to be spume out with minimal preparation. The capacity of the turret is limited due to the maximum orb size. The flame itself is Rubion in plasma state which is highly volatile and can burn any missile or fighter with ease.",,,
