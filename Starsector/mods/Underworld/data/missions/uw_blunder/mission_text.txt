When the lottery came up, Pirate Lord Bonaparte ceremonially drew the name of the next star system his pirate horde would ransack. Proudly proclaiming the result over wideband to the entire star system, Bonaparte brought The Infernal Machine to bear against Omega Serpentis.

Resistance around Eden was light. Bonaparte expected an uneventful end to the horde's exploits, as it seemed that the Church did not greatly value Omega Serpentis. Mere days before departing, The Infernal Machine picked up a jump signature from the outskirts of the system: an enormous Purification fleet, led by the CGR Inquisitor. Scrambling to activate The Infernal Machine's engines, Pirate Lord Bonaparte made haste to exit the system.

This proved to be futile, due to the poor travel drive that the Infernus-class suffers from. Soon, only the most loyal captains amongst the once-mighty horde remained. Shortly before descending upon him, the Grand Cleric sent Pirate Lord Bonaparte a final farewell: "Your vassals' disloyalty betrays your true nature. Justice demands your destruction for your sins against humanity. Make peace with the blessed void, for it will be your eternal home. Praise be to Ludd!"
