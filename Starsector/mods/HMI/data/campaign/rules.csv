Even through your own rebreather you can smell salt, produced from the refining of Red Water - clearly your rebreather is not up to snuff.

Contiunuing further into the concorse towards the administration area you enter a red-tinged atrium, a glass wall overlooking the ocean of crimson below. The sight is deeply unnerving, although you cannot explain why - until it occurs to you that you espy the regular motion of waves on the ocean, despite there being no atmosphere. The data slate blames the effect on the surface tension being held together by the organic mass within the ocean, which only puts you mildly at ease. Amongst the background noise of the pumping machines you swear you hear the sound of breaking waves, washing on a dead grey beach, and maybe...just maybe...the voice of a Mother you never met.

Your ship detects faint readings from the slender structures, possibly decay from an old fission reactor finally giving out, or maybe accumulated extrastellar radiation from centuries of exposure. 

When your $shipOrFleet is close enough to establish visual contact, the delta-class AI in charge of analysing the sensor data starts reporting increased energy readings from the core of the station itself. At the same time your sensor officer contradicts the report saying the station is a dead hulk, like many others before it.

Interestingly, when the stray round from fighting shattered the station, it appears to have gone straight through some strange, exotic-looking structure at the core, linked up to a treasure trove of low-grade AI cores. While acquiring the surprise bounty, your nervous salvage team locates a server encased in sturdy plasteel connected to the bizarre AI core network. The outer shell is partially destroyed, with the physical server storage inside mostly intact.

On downloading the contents of the server and analysing the data, you finally discover what just happened. Apparently, a secret Tri-Tachyon project was looking into mind control and had set up in this abandoned research station before the First AI War. They discovered that a combination of subliminal messaging, hypnotics, implant hacking, and several other vaguely mentioned pieces of ominous technology could be used to provide an aggressive form of mind control. The overall idea was to hack the target's comms, sensor and life support systems and cause enemy fleets to turn against themselves in paranoid delusion and hallucination. However, at some point the project was terminated - why is not clear. There are some references to vaguely mentioned technology used by the apparatus causing an 'Instrumentality Event', which you believe is the possibility of a beta level, or even an alpha level AI core taking over the mind control system and turning the researchers against themselves.

Nevertheless, while the project was ostensibly shut down, this station was left dormant for future usage in something called the 'Seele Project' with the mind control system set to self-defence. Your $shipOrFleet had fallen prey to this defense system; it was not some ghost ship you were fighting, but in fact it was your $shipOrFleet tearing itself apart!

Then, like a hull-breach siren siren the mad rigger's laughing cuts through the comms, her salvage shuttle streaking low across the surface. It ducks and weaves over the rolling surface, before sharply rising upwards. The salvage chief is yelling something, but it's drowned out as she screams in delight,

And then you feel your stomach fall out from under you as whatever salvageable material could have been aquired is converted into space dust by hungry nanites before your eyes, your salvors running scared and giving panicked calls back to command. The salvage chief just glares at you, knowing exactly how bad of an idea it was to even consider harvesting the crumbling hulk, and here they stand, vindicated. You are more upset about the loss of the hulk - what might have been a goldmine of Nanite Mess just went up in smoke.

""By Ludd,"" you suddenly hear the Sensor officer utter in shock, ""Look what just came out of the fissure!""

Amazed, you watch as the Mess cannibalises itself into dust before your eyes, leaving behind the shadow of a cruiser-sized ship.",liminaBeatDefendersContinue4:Continue,,,

It vaguely resembles the Coelum-class seen in Remnant fleets, but it's too clean, too alien in appearance. At once, you begin to consider salvaging it. The prospect does not sound appealing - this ship was buried deep within the bowels of a nanite infested station that just reduced itself to space dust, with no guarantee that this object won't do the exact same thing. But you've come too far, fought to hard to leave with nothing.

The following negotiations are quickly made with your sputtering salvage chief, and become very loud once or twice, before your chief begrudging sends the incredulous salvage crews out to the ship. The command is made slightly easier by your sensor officer reporting a surprising absence of nanite infection on the ship.

Essentially a stray bit of code in the degraded systems picked up a Tri-Tachyon demand to refine the Coelum design, and set to work fulfilling it under the name ""Limina"". Except the Mess kept eating the ship, so the AI kept rebuilding the ship and redesigning it to resist nanite consumption.

But in all honesty I'm amazed that a ship-wide nanite infection is not only kept under control, but is actually used to maintain and repair the ship itself!

The chief's smile fades as they see they're beginning to lose you, ""Alternatively, you could just see it as a ship that's nigh immortal in the hands of a good pilot. The ship's ready to be reactivated. Should we proceed with recovery?""",#recoverlimina:Recover the ship,,,

Particularly of interest is a set of schematics and blueprints that can vastly improve the quality of life on a colony. Everything from air filters that can remove toxic gases and convert them into passive energy, to seals that do not degrade under the most vigorous chemical assault, to thin radiation plating that can block just as well as fifty feet of high-end rad shields can be easily constructed from the blueprints using trivially sourced materials. Using these designs and more, colonial exploitation can be made considerably less hazardous for the enterprising colonist.",0:hmi_domres_explore:Fantastic!,,,
domres_stationpristineFacility,DialogOptionSelected,$option == hmi_domres_explore,,"In addition to this trove of fine salvage, you also have a giant hulk of machinery and scrap to process. As your teams take the ship apart, your team locates the records of recieved communications stored on giant, chunky magna-data slates. Curious, you have the ancient dataslates mined. It takes several hours for the poor bastard stuck with the job to finish the task of plying the rad-fried hardware and hideously outdated software to satisfy your curiosity, but eventually a summary is sent to your console.

The first messages are simple orders to claim high priority systems for a 'South Expanse Company'. Later, the communications change source from the company to 'Domain Resurgent', although whether the company changed names or the organisation co-opted the company's assets is unclear. There are some rudimentary surveying information transfers evaluating possible terraforming possibilities, and then a series of increasingly frantic commands which indicate co-ordinates south-west and travel. However, due to some damage in the station or interference, the commands are incomplete. They either demand 'travel' or they give coordinates  but never in the same message. The final command is a Defence Activation, which caused the station to go into star system lock-down and unleash roaming fleets. The final entry, however, is a communication from an unknown source:

""Attention to all Domain Resurgent colonies, if you still exist... or even existed in the first place. Manchester has fallen. A pirate called Scarborough rounded up all the refugees the ""wise adminstrators"" didn't let in and invaded. They, they nuked Exeter to dust. However, it turns out, that our ""wise administrators"" were lying about Exeter being overflowing with food, and the ""mighty forges of Devon"" feeding their empire - they barely had enough food to feed themselves and had wasted everything else on...on YOU guys. Whatever's left of the ""wise administrators"" is making a last stand in order to call in all their defence assets to kill Scarborough. If your automated defence stations just left for no reason, you now know why. But, if you have any sense you WILL. NOT. Follow them.  Whoever wins there's nothing left here. Anything the Domain Resurgent hasn't wasted, Scarborough has burned. We survivors who are ditching our ""wise administrators"" are heading to a system south-west of Manchester - and this time, we're going to succeed where the Domain Resurgent failed.""",0:hmi_domres_salvage_pick:A sad story.
